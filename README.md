# AP Computer Science Principles Midterm Exam

For this project, complete the exercises sketched out in the exam.py file.

When done correctly, your program should have the same output as the output.txt file, with the exception of lines with \*\*\* to denote random number generation or custom user inputs affecting the output.

When done, commit and push your progress so that it is visible to me.
